# BYE BYE SLACKY
I thought the post by slack was arrogant - https://slackhq.com/dear-microsoft-8d20965d2849#.7qmtf2po6. Let's experiment if we can build a set of apps to migrate just everything from slack. 

# Migrate
 - [ ] Users
 - [ ] Channels
 - [ ] Channel Messages, with users & files.
 - [ ] Private messages?
 - [ ] messages with bot? :O - too ambitious.
 - [ ] Everything - it should be bye bye ***slacky***
